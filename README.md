# Todo Application

A simple Todo application with a **frontend** built using **React.js** and a **backend** built using **Node.js** (Express.js). The project is fully containerized with **Docker** for ease of development, deployment, and scaling.

## Features

- **Frontend**: A clean and responsive interface to add, view, update, and delete tasks.
- **Backend**: A REST API to handle task management operations such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for todos.
- **Authentication**: User authentication (optional, if implemented).
- **Dockerized**: Both frontend and backend are Dockerized for easy setup and deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: (Optional) MongoDB, MySQL, or any other database
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) on your system.
- Docker Desktop should be running.

### Running the Application Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-application.git
   cd todo-application
Build the Docker images:

To build the frontend image:

```bash
docker build -t misbahuddintareq/todo-frontend ./todo-frontend
```

To build the backend image:

```bash
docker build -t misbahuddintareq/todo-backend ./todo-backend
```
Run the Docker containers:

To run the frontend container on port 3000:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 misbahuddintareq/todo-frontend
```

To run the backend container on port 4000:

```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 misbahuddintareq/todo-backend
```

Open your browser and visit the following URLs:
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend: http://localhost:4000

Using Docker Compose (Optional)
If you prefer to use Docker Compose to manage both containers at once, you can do the following:

Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory:

yaml
Copy code
version: '3'
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./todo-frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  backend:
    build: ./todo-backend
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
Run the application using:

```bash
docker-compose up
This will start both the frontend and backend containers simultaneously.
```

Pushing Docker Images to Docker Hub
First, tag your images with your Docker Hub username:

```bash
docker tag misbahuddintareq/todo-frontend:latest yourusername/todo-frontend:latest
docker tag misbahuddintareq/todo-backend:latest yourusername/todo-backend:latest
```

Push the images to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push yourusername/todo-frontend:latest
docker push yourusername/todo-backend:latest
```

Replace yourusername with your actual Docker Hub username.
